# Smart Fridge App - Project Completion Report

## Project Overview

This project involved the design and development of a prototype Smart Fridge Application. The primary goals were to enable users to track items in their fridge, monitor expiration dates, receive alerts for expiring items, and get recipe suggestions based on available ingredients.

## Features Implemented

1.  **Inventory Management:**
    *   Users can manually add items with their names and quantities to the fridge inventory via a web interface.
    *   The system automatically attempts to determine a general expiration date for added items using a simulated AI service.
    *   The current inventory, along with expiration dates, is displayed to the user.
    *   Basic CRUD (Create, Read) operations for inventory items are supported through the backend API and frontend UI for adding and viewing items. Update and Delete functionalities are stubbed in the backend API but not fully implemented in the current UI.
    *   A conceptual endpoint for processing fridge images to automatically update inventory was created in the backend, simulating item identification and changes (add/remove).

2.  **Expiration Alerts:**
    *   Due to system limitations preventing automated scheduled tasks (like cron jobs), a manual trigger system for expiration alerts was implemented.
    *   Users can click a button on the web interface to check for items expiring soon.
    *   The system provides two levels of alerts: items expiring within 1 week and items expiring within 3 days.
    *   These alerts are displayed on the frontend.

3.  **Recipe Generation:**
    *   Users can request recipe suggestions based on the current items in their fridge inventory.
    *   The system uses a simulated AI service to generate recipes.
    *   Generated recipes, including name, ingredients, and instructions, are displayed on the web interface.
    *   The backend supports saving favorite recipes, though this is not yet integrated into the current frontend UI.

4.  **Shopping List (Conceptual):**
    *   The initial plan included shopping list generation. While not fully implemented in the UI, the backend database schema includes considerations for user preferences which could be extended for this.

## Technology Stack

*   **Backend:**
    *   Framework: Python with Flask
    *   Database: MongoDB (local instance)
    *   Services: Python-based services for simulated AI (item/expiration identification, recipe generation) and notifications.
*   **Frontend:**
    *   Framework: React (created using `create_react_app` template)
    *   API Communication: Axios
*   **Development Environment:** Ubuntu 22.04 sandbox

## Key Project Files Structure

            *   `db_connector.py`: MongoDB connection setup.
            *   `main.py`: Flask application entry point.
        *   `venv/`: Python virtual environment.
        *   `requirements.txt`: (To be generated before final packaging, listing Python dependencies like Flask, pymongo).

*   `/home/ubuntu/project_summary.md`: This report.

## Limitations and Future Enhancements

*   **Automated Notifications:** The current notification system relies on manual triggering due to environment limitations on scheduled tasks. Future work could involve deploying to an environment that supports cron jobs or using a cloud-based scheduler for automated daily checks.
*   **Image Processing:** Item identification via image processing is currently simulated. A real implementation would require integrating with actual computer vision services or models.
*   **AI Integration:** The AI services for expiration dates and recipe generation are simulated. Real AI/ML models or APIs (like Perplexity or Vertex AI as initially discussed) would need to be integrated.
*   **User Interface:** The UI is a basic prototype. Enhancements could include more sophisticated item management (update/delete), user accounts, persistent user preferences, shopping list features, and a more polished design.
*   **Error Handling & Security:** Basic error handling is in place. A production application would require more robust error handling, input validation, and security measures (e.g., authentication, authorization, HTTPS).
*   **Deployment:** The application is currently set up to run in the development environment. Deployment would require containerization (e.g., Docker) and hosting on a suitable platform.

## Instructions to Run (Conceptual)

**Backend (Flask):**
1.  Navigate to `/home/ubuntu/smart_fridge_app/backend/smart_fridge_api`.
2.  Ensure MongoDB is running.
3.  Activate the virtual environment: `source venv/bin/activate`.
4.  Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (Note: `requirements.txt` should be generated if not present using `pip freeze > requirements.txt` within the venv).
5.  Run the Flask app: `python3 src/main.py`. The API will be available at `http://localhost:5001`.

**Frontend (React):**
1.  Navigate to `/home/ubuntu/smart_fridge_app/frontend/frontend_app`.
2.  Install dependencies: `pnpm install` (or `npm install`).
3.  Start the development server: `pnpm run dev` (or `npm start`). The UI will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port specified by React).

This prototype provides a foundational set of features for a smart fridge application. Further development can build upon this base to create a more comprehensive and robust solution.
